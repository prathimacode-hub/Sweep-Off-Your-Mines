# SWEEP OFF YOUR MINES

## INSPIRATION

Inspiration from basic minesweeper game 

## PROJECT

This project is an antique minesweeper but with a pinch of twist embedded in it. It would definitely raise out your eyebrows. So in basic minesweeper game, we select blocks which can be shown. But here the puzzle is, you won't find any blocks. It's all a mere luck and random clicks. Let's see how far you can get through this.

## HOW IT'S BUILT

This hack has been built up using pure python where we had added main file, engine file and evil file. Main file does the functionalities, engine file does the operations needed to activate main file and evil file which would show up danger when pressed and game gets over.

## CHALLENGES FACED

The main point of challenge is how to make this innovative which wouldn't look up like evergreen minesweeper game. So for this, I had to integrate a plain background screen. This would look like wondering even if the project is executed or not. But it is, just press randomly and see how this game works. Here I had added up M using alphabetic input instead of bombs in basic minesweeper game. Also enlarged the play screen size so that it looks overwhelming as well as provide curiosity as to know if the hack even exist

## ACCOMPLISHED 

This is completely different from how you expect it to look or work. Feels elated to have achieved this by working solo without any help. I'm definitely not a gamer to come up with an action or adventurous games. These are the only games I knew and grown up with as all systems comes filled up with. I only play suduku, word games and basic computer games I am provided with. So next time whenever I got to lift my brain, I would dive me hands on to this game and be self independent

## WHAT I LEARNT

I had learnt many things especially in bringing up the major changes in python application files to make this look weird and providing it as a driving force for this exciting game to work. Completely building up from scratch was a tensed feeling as to think if this would really get my work done.

## FUTURE FOR SWEEP OFF YOUR MINES

The next chapter for this minesweeper would be to add up the scores and buttons to make it more funny and user friendly.
